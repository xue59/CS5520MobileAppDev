A1 First App 

Create an app with the following:

1. Hello World! text
2. An About Me button.  When that button is clicked, the app displays a Toast with your name and email.
3. A unique icon for the app that gets placed on the phoneâ€™s app list in the launcher

A3 Clicky Clicky

Label the buttons A, B, C, D, E, and F in the buttons.  In addition to the buttons, put a line of text underneath the buttons (think of it as where the third row of buttons would have been if it was a 3 x 3 grid).  That line of text should read "Pressed: - " because no buttons have been clicked yet.  When a button is clicked, the text should change to "Pressed: A", where A is the letter of the button that was clicked.  When another button is clicked, then the text will change to show that button.  If the display is rotated, the text will change back to "Pressed: -".  (We will learn how to handle display rotation properly in a future week.)  The text should be centered in the horizontal direction.  In the vertical direction, try to space things nicely, which means that you don't want the first row touching the top of the display while the Pressed text has extra space below it, and you don't want anything (button or text) squished up against each other (meaning: leave space between them).
